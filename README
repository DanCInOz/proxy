1. DESCRIPTION

This is a simple proxy daemon that allows you to forward TCP requests hitting a specified port on a local host to a different port on another host. It is written in ANSI C so it takes a very little space and can be used on embedded devices.

2. INSTALLATION

On Linux compile the software using "make". On Windows use "make" from Cygwin (http://cygwin.com).

To build an executable for Tomato firmware (http://www.polarcloud.com/tomato) you need to have the mipsel toolchain installed. Fetch it with git:

git clone git://repo.or.cz/tomato.git tomato

and follow instructions in the "tools/README.TXT" file.

3. USAGE

Command line syntax goes as follows:

proxy local_port remote_host remote_port

Suppose you want to open port 8080 on a public host and forward all TCP packets to port 80 on machine 192.168.1.2 in the local network. In this case you install proxy on a public host and run it the following command:

./proxy 8080 192.168.1.2 80
